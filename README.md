## About
This app uses the spotify, omdb and bands in town to display responses based on what the user wants from the command input. It recognizes a language that is set by the user and interprets in based on what the user want to ouput. For example the spotify function accepts "spotify-this-song" as an argument and later searches whatever artist the user wants to know or learn about. Same applies to omdb and bands in down accepting user inputs like "movie-this" and "do-what-it-says" respectively.
